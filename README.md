# Docker images for running Exaile's CI pipeline

To build locally, run `./build.sh NAME VERSION`.
`NAME` is one of the `Dockerfile.*` name suffixes.
`VERSION` is generally the version of the target OS, although each Dockerfile
can treat it differently.

For example, running `./build.sh debian 12` creates an image using
`Dockerfile.debian` based on `docker.io/debian:12-slim`.
